"Introduction to Mathematics" and related documents associated w/ g/project

Please begin with the [Introduction](intro.md) page.

The purpose of this is to demonstrate how mathematics serves as your "first language" so to speak.

Although formal, math is an intrinsic language that inspires insight (the understanding of cause and effect
within a particular context), observing and finding inherent relationships, similarities and differences.

Terence Tao - *“The intention of mathematics is to communicate concepts and ideas in a very precise way.”*

We are then suppose to adapt the consistency of modern mathematical operations—inferring what happens
within conventional programming language/systems—to ultimately guide and build intuitions further.

The most bemusing point of all this is *how to learn math from scratch*—how to think about things
from a fundamental point of view. Alas, this doesnt exclude math as it is used within progressive
fields of math, programming and computer graphics, etcetera.

So whether we are looking at mathematics in electrical and computer engineering contexts, programming
and/or working with SIMD vectorization, or advanced math that requires spherical quaternion interp—we'll
suffuse a dynamic approach that lets us circularly *paint around* any such topic of interest.
